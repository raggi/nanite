    # Make a nanite request which expects a response.
    #
    # ==== Parameters
    # type<String>:: The dispatch route for the request
    # payload<Object>:: Payload to send.  This will get marshalled en route
    #
    # ==== Options
    # :selector<Symbol>:: Method for selecting an actor.  Default is :least_loaded.
    #   :least_loaded:: Pick the nanite which has the lowest load.
    #   :all:: Send the request to all nanites which respond to the service.
    #   :random:: Randomly pick a nanite.
    #   :rr: Select a nanite according to round robin ordering.
    # :timeout<Numeric>:: The timeout in seconds before giving up on a response.
    #   Defaults to 60.
    # :target<String>:: Select a specific nanite via identity, rather than using
    #   a selector.
    #
    # ==== Block Parameters
    # :results<Object>:: The returned value from the nanite actor.
    #
    # @api :public:

  # Mappers are control nodes in nanite clusters. Nanite clusters
  # can follow peer-to-peer model of communication as well as client-server,
  # and mappers are nodes that know who to send work requests to.
  #
  # Mappers can reside inside a front end web application written in Merb/Rails
  # and distribute heavy lifting to actors that register with the mapper as soon
  # as they go online.
  #
  # Each mapper tracks nanites registered with it. It periodically checks
  # when the last time a certain nanite sent a heartbeat notification,
  # and removes those that have timed out from the list of available workers.
  # As soon as a worker goes back online again it re-registers itself
  # and the mapper adds it to the list and makes it available to
  # be called again.
  #
  # This makes Nanite clusters self-healing and immune to individual node
  # failures.
  #
  # Nanites known to mapper are stored in a hash, where keys are nanite
  # identities (that you specify using the :identity option), and whose value
  # is a hash consisting of the triple representing timestamps/status/services.
